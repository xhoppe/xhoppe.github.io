Here we introduce some main concepts of Xhoppe.

## Products

Products are at the core of any e-commerce site. A product could have some properties, for example, a T-shirt has material, a mobile phone has screen size, resolution etc.

## Product Properties

Properties are typically used to provide additional information about a product to help the customer make a better purchase decision. 

## Option Types and Option Values

Option Types are a way to help distinguish products in your store from one another. They are particularly useful when you have many products that are basically of the same general category (Tshirts or mugs, for example), but with characteristics that can vary, such as color, size, or logo.

For each Option Type, you will need to create one or more corresponding Option Values. If you create a “Size” Option Type, then you would need Option Values for it like “Small”, “Medium”, and “Large”.

## Prototypes

A Prototype is like a Product blueprint, useful for helping you add a group of similar new products to your store more quickly. The general procedure is that you create a Prototype which is associated with certain Option Types and Properties; then you create products based on that Prototype, and only need to fill in the values for those Option Types and Properties.

Imagine that you’ve just received a new shipment of picture frames from your supplier. Your new stock encompasses a variety of brands, sizes, colors, and materials, but they are all basically the same type of product. This is a prime use case for prototypes.
